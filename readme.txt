ProjectDescription:
    Name: homeFit
    Description: 
    My goal for this project is to implement a program that gives the user a solid workout given the user attributes and inputed constraints.
    The workouts consist of simple bodyweight exercises that anyone can do, and the user chooses a category that they would like to focus on.
    Given an intensity and time constraint, the program will generate an optimized workout so that the user can burn calories and stay in shape
    using the simplex algorithm. If a workout is too easy, the program will also adjust and make it slightly harder each time.

Run Project:
    Users simply have to run the 'main.py' file and everything else can be accessed within the project itself.

Project Libraries:
    cmu_112_graphics.py (Included in this folder)
    Beautiful Soup
    Requests
    Tkinter
    Pillow

Shortcut Commands:
    If the user has already inputed their data from before, the program stores their data so they do not need to register as a new user each time
