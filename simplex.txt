Note: If it's a minimization, turn it into a maximization

Steps for Minimum: 
1. put coefficients into a matrix (minimization function as well)
    where ax1 + bx2 = c
2. transpose the matrix
3. restate the problem as a maximization 

Steps for Maximum:
1. Add slack variables
2. Create simplex tableau
3. Find the most negative coefficient in the maximization
4. Find the smallest number when the right column / numbers in the column of the most negative coefficient (Pivot)
5. Make the pivot 1
6. Do calculations such that every other row has a 0 in that column
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until there are no negative values in the bottom
8. Get the non basic- variables and the max value
9. Check to see if the values fit the constraints
